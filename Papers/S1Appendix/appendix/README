This archive (S1_Appendix.zip) contains the source code for the model presented in the
paper 'A Landscape Approach to Invasive Species Management'.

The model was implemented in R and there are two source files:

1.- model-metapops.r is a self-contained script that can be run straightaway and
will produce the output for the model metapopulation networks as described in the 
main text. This script stores the output information in a .csv file containing the
summary statistics for the simulation executions as well as a series of .pdf figures
that are the panels in Figure 1 of the main manuscript.

2.- real-world-metapops.r on the other hand, implements basically the same model but
using the real-world landscapes described in the manuscript to create the metapopulation
structure. It then runs the in-silico experiments on these real-world landscapes. Unlike
the previous script this is dependant on the directory 'landscapes' which comes within
the archive and should appear in this same directory. Within this directory, a series
of .csv files describing the real-world landscapes generated as described in the main 
text of the paper are contained. The script uses these files as input files to generate
the real-world metapopulation structures on which to perform the in-silico management
experiments. As with the previous script, pdf and csv files are produced as outputs for
figures and summary stats respectively.

Both source code scripts are commented for an easy understanding of the steps involved
in the model executions.
